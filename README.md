# Estimation_of_customer-value_and_its_temporal_validity_in_online_gaming
Here we are predicting a customer-value (how valuable is the customer to the company) and a temporal value (indicating how long is this prediction valid) for an online Rummy game. The input feature space contains 22 variables spanning across multiple aspects of customer behaviour. Temporal variation is captured by a numbered sequence of entries for each customer. The goal is to predict Y1 &amp; Y2 which represent customer value and temporal extrapolation respectively. Each customer can have N sequenced entries as input and only one set of (Y1, Y2) is expected as output.
